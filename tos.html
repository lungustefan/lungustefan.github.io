    <h1>STEFAN’S BASEMENT – TERMS OF SUFFERING</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> Like We Care</p>

    <h2>1. THIS SERVICE SUCKS. DON’T EXPECT OTHERWISE.</h2>
    <p>This service is provided <strong>AS-IS</strong> and <strong>AS-AVAILABLE</strong>. It might work today, might not work tomorrow, and might just self-destruct entirely. If it functions, that’s a miracle. If it doesn’t, we told you so.</p>

    <h2>2. SUPPORT? HAHAHAHAHA!</h2>
    <p>Yes, we offer support—but <strong>only when we feel like it</strong>. If you get help, count your blessings. If you don’t, welcome to reality. We do not promise replies, resolutions, or even basic human decency.</p>

    <h2>3. DOWNTIME WILL HAPPEN. CRY ABOUT IT.</h2>
    <p>Your precious little project <strong>will</strong> experience downtime. Maybe an hour, maybe a day, maybe forever. If we feel generous, we might fix it. If we don’t, sucks to be you.</p>

    <h2>4. DATA LOSS? HOPE YOU HAD BACKUPS.</h2>
    <p>Your data is like a sandcastle at high tide—it’s going to vanish, and there’s nothing you can do about it. We take no responsibility for lost files, corrupted databases, or Stefan accidentally deleting the server while trying to fix his Wi-Fi.</p>

    <h2>5. YOUR UPTIME MONITOR MEANS NOTHING TO US.</h2>
    <p>If your monitoring bot pings you at 3 AM saying we’re down, congratulations! You now know what we already don’t care about. Do <strong>not</strong> message us. We already ignored the first 500 alerts.</p>

    <h2>6. PERFORMANCE? LOL.</h2>
    <p>We do not promise good speeds, low latency, or anything that even remotely resembles quality. If you think your website deserves premium resources, <strong>you’re in the wrong basement</strong>.</p>

    <h2>7. LEGAL CLAIMS? HA. GOOD LUCK.</h2>
    <p>By using this service, you officially agree to <strong>never sue us</strong> for anything, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data loss</li>
        <li>Server outages</li>
        <li>Your failed startup</li>
        <li>The downfall of civilization</li>
        <li>Stefan’s questionable life choices</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even if <strong>we</strong> directly cause the issue, <strong>that’s still your problem.</strong></p>

    <h2>8. DISPUTES? PACK YOUR BAGS, WE’RE GOING TO ROMANIA.</h2>
    <p>Think you have a legal claim? Fantastic. You agree to <strong>arbitrate in Romania</strong>, in a location of <strong>our choosing</strong> (probably some sketchy basement). You also agree to <strong>pay all legal fees</strong>, including ours, even if you lose (which you will).</p>

    <h2>9. THERE ARE RULES, BUT YOU WON’T LIKE THEM.</h2>
    <p>We don’t care about much, but we do care about these things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No illegal content.</strong> (We’re dumb, but not that dumb.)</li>
        <li><strong>No abusing resources.</strong> (If we see you mining crypto, we will mine your dignity.)</li>
        <li><strong>No whining.</strong> (Seriously, go away.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Break these, and we will <strong>erase your existence from our servers without warning.</strong></p>

    <h2>10. WE CAN BAN YOU FOR LITERALLY ANY REASON.</h2>
    <p>If we don’t like you, you’re gone. If we wake up in a bad mood, you’re gone. If Stefan’s cat walks across the keyboard, <strong>you’re gone</strong>. There are no appeals.</p>

    <h2>11. BY USING THIS SERVICE, YOU ACCEPT THIS NIGHTMARE.</h2>
    <p>If you don’t like these terms, <strong>leave</strong>. If you continue using this service, you acknowledge that you’re making a <strong>horrible decision</strong>, and we are in no way responsible for the disaster that follows.</p>

    <p><strong>Welcome to Stefan’s Basement. You have been warned.</strong></p>
